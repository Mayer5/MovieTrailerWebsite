My Movie Trailers: 
      This is a simple program for generating a movie trailers' website.

How to Run:

  (It will generate an "index.html" then use your default web browser to open it.)

    entertainment_center.py   ---the control center for reading data and call other functions.
    media.py                  ---the Movie Class.
    fresh_tomatoes.py         ---the program for setting html file's content and layout.
    movies.json               ---the json file which contains movies' detail information.
    images/                   ---the folder which contains images(posters).
    index.html                ---the html file generated by the program.
